## 📌 Documentation Versioning Policy

This project maintains documentation that references Microsoft Copilot Studio UI and features. Microsoft regularly updates Copilot Studio, which may cause discrepancies between our documentation and the current UI.

### Our Commitment:
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Documentation is reviewed and updated every quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
- **Version Tracking**: Each major documentation update is tracked with a version number
- **Official References**: We always link to official Microsoft documentation for the most current information
- **Community Updates**: We welcome community contributions to keep documentation current

### How to Report Discrepancies:
If you notice that our documentation doesn't match the current Copilot Studio UI:
1. Open an issue on GitHub with the tag `documentation-outdated`
2. Include screenshots showing the difference
3. Reference the specific section and document
4. We'll prioritize updates based on impact
